        <h2 id="media" onclick="javascript:showTextbox(this.id);"><span class="material-icons">image</span>&nbsp;Media Fetching: YouTube, Images, GIFs</h2>
        <div class="textbox" id="media-text">AwesomeBot provides useful commands for Google Image Search, Giphy access, and full YouTube search. In addition, you can fetch data from Wikipedia, Wolfram|Alpha, MSN Weather, and even links to apps on the Play Store and App Store.<br><br></div> 
        <h2 id="rssr" onclick="javascript:showTextbox(this.id);"><span class="material-icons">refresh</span>&nbsp;RSS Articles and Reddit posts</h2>
        <div class="textbox" id="rssr-text">Reddit and RSS can become integral to the Discord experience with AwesomeBot. We allow server mods to set custom RSS feeds, and our Reddit viewer includes data beyond just the link. Fetching is fast and simple with our streamlined command processing.<br><br></div>
        <h2 id="profiles" onclick="javascript:showTextbox(this.id);"><span class="material-icons">person</span>&nbsp;Discord User Profiles</h2>
        <div class="textbox" id="profiles-text">Often, you want everyone to know something about you. With AwesomeBot, you can add information to your user profile across Discord to express yourself. Even if you don't use this, the capable profile command shows information about each user's account and activity on the server.<br><br></div>
        <h2 id="stats" onclick="javascript:showTextbox(this.id);"><span class="material-icons">poll</span>&nbsp;Full-Featured Per-Server Stats</h2>
        <div class="textbox" id="stats-text">One of the best features of AwesomeBot is our full-featured, per-server stats system that logs every message sent and game played. You can view up-to-date information about the most popular members and games. This even includes viewing messages you've been mentioned in over the past week and having AwesomeBot PM you if you're mentioned and you're offline.<br><br></div>
        <h2 id="pollt" onclick="javascript:showTextbox(this.id);"><span class="material-icons">play_circle_filled</span>&nbsp;In-Chat Polls and Trivia Game</h2>
